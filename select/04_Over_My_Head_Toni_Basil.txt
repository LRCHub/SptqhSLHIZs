You'd better look out 'cause suspicious eyes are watching
Don't let them see us holding hands
I know that you and I should not be seen here talking
I kinda like the razor's edge

I always go for danger, like to walk a tightrope
I do my show without a net
It never fails, I'll dive into the deepest ocean
Not knowing if I'll sink or swim

Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh
Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh

We're always meeting in the dark, it's hard to see you
I'll feel my way, I'll take a chance
Risking exposure every time I come to meet you
I'm back with lady luck, again

Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh
Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh

I got a feeling, this time I can't take it
You'll play the game in a place for real
Although I'm falling so fast already
I'm deeper than I should be
I'm over my head

Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh
Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh
Oh, oh, I'm over my head, oh, oh
Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh
(I'm over my head)

Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh (Over my head)
Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh (I'm over my head)
Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh (Over my head)
Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh (I'm over my head)

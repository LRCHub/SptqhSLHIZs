Am I out of my depth?
Uninterrupted multiplicity, this is where you lose me
Come again, if you please?
Aluminium lunar luminous is taking over us
Am I missing the point?
This reeling speel, forgive me if I'm wrong
But are you making this up as you go along?
And it bores me to tears
Get a handle on the dialogue
It's a one man show
It's a monologue

I could be slow I don't know
You just went over my head
I don't understand a word you just said

I could be slow I don't know
You just went over my head
I don't understand a word you just said

I can't figure it out
This cascading fountain of nothingness, you're a mess
I simply cannot believe
You met a mighty metamorphous, that's ridiculous
I am somewhat confused
Selected, collected from the gene pool
They can keep you youthful?
Well, excusez-moi, Monsieur Cosmique, je suis protoplasmique, qu'est-ce que c'est?

How can I spell it out for you
I am no ordinary fool
And even though there's nothing left to say
You go ahead and say it anyway

I could be slow I don't know
You just went over my head
I don't understand a word you just said

I could be slow I don't know
You just went over my head
I don't understand a word you just said

I could be slow I don't know
You just went over my head
I don't understand a word you just said

I could be slow I don't know
You just went over my head
I don't understand a word you just said

I could be slow I don't know
You just went over my head
I don't understand a word you just said

I could be slow I don't know
You just went over my head
I don't understand a word you just said

I could be slow I don't know
You just went over my head
I don't understand a word you just said

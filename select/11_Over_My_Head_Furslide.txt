I lost an island in the ocean
The place where nickels come to gamble on their faces
She took the offer to be the daughter
We pledge allengiance to the one who affers social graces

Please don't blame me
Please don't blame me

'Cause I'm in over my head
In over my head
It's for the best

I ripped up the picture
The one in the kitchen
I looked weak my eyes they gave it all away
I don't deny it
I still haven't found it
I proudly wear the scars
I've challenged every crutch so far

Please don't blame me
Please don't blame me
'Cause I'm in over my head, in over my head
It's for the best and I'm in over my head, in over my head
It's for the best

Please don't blame me
Please don't blame me
'Cause I'm in over my head, in over my head
It's for the best and I'm in over my head, in over my head
It's for the best

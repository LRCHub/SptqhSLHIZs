Over my head I hear music in the air
Over my head I hear music
Over my head it's loud and clear
It's going to my head

Music, music, I hear music
Music, I hear music, music, music oh oh oh Lord
Music over my head
I, I, I, I hear it so clear
I, I, I hear it so dear
I know, I know, I know I'm not crazy
It's going to my head

Music, music, I hear music
Music, oh I hear music, music
Music oh oh oh lord, yeah
Music over my head
She was saying it
Music, music, I hear music
Music I hear music

Grandma used to sing
Grandma used to sing
Everynight while she was prayin'
Over my head
Over my head
I hear music oh Lord

Music, music, I hear music
Music, I hear music, music
Music oh oh oh Lord
Music over my head
Music over my head

Music, music, I hear music
Music, I hear music, music
Music oh oh oh Lord
Music over my head
Music over my head

Can't you hear it?
I, I, I hear it
Don't you hear it?
Listen it's all around me
Is it everywhere?

Over my head
Lord she was singing, singing just like yesterday
I'm talkin' talkin' talkin' in my sleep
Oh I could feel it
Let's do the music
Music over my head
